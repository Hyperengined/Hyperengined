Hi ! I'm Overengined
I like coding , and particularily coding related to science, space, or STEM in general (with however a preference for the two firsts ðŸ˜‰). <br />
I'm quite good at python and have some practice in powershell and C++. I can also do some html, event though it isn't my favorite language. <br />
I also love art and design and do some myself. <br />
(I'm also a native french speaker, but really, is that so important XD) <br />
If you want to contact me then feel free to use discord ( Overengined#7491) I don't usually accept "shady" friend request, but if your GitHub account is linked to your discord one, I might accept. <br />
I would love to colaborate (and NOT only on code, but also on knwoledge or translation) on any project that would fit my interests. <br /> 
Yours truely <br />
Over <br />
